* Free text â€“ a description of the assignment. Stuff that you found
hard to implement, known bugs and your review of this
assignment

## Things you will need
The mock API. So get familiar with it: https://mockapi.io

## The task
You will create a CRUD app. It can be for tasks, products (e.g a list of shoes), or anything else (e.g list of nuclear missiles).
What's important is to practice the CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete with a real API.

Some important points:
* The app will use the mock api.
* Use api.js to organize all of the requests to the mock api.

## Good places to start from:
* Set up the API first. Get the CRUD working there.
* Then show it somehow in the DOM using a component.
* From there - continue.

## Extras:
* Make sure that your data is valid. For example - name is not empty etc. If not, do not allow to save the item.
* When saving, prevert the user from clicking multiple times on save, to generate multiple identical requests.
* Spinner: implement a loading spinner that will be displayed whenever you are making
an ajax request.
* You can axois if you want, or plain fetch.
